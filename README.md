For Kaggle competitions

## Titanic Competition:
My current data analysis code is in the .ipynb file.

To make the notebook work, I think you have to go to the competition webpage:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview

Then, you have to press the "Code" button and import my .ipynb file there maybe?
